# Prompt PRD: Gemma OCR App

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:
Build a local-first OCR web app in **Python** using **Streamlit** for the UI and **Ollama** to interface with **Gemma 3**, a local LLM. The app should allow users to upload an image, perform OCR via Gemma 3, and output the result in **Markdown format**.

model_name = "gemma3:latest"

##Instructions:

- [ ] Display Markdown output on the UI using `st.markdown()`.
- [ ] Add "Copy to Clipboard" and "Download as .md" buttons.
